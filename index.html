        <p class="paragraph">I have a brother, who is 15 years old and currently is studying in class 9. He does not too good in his class but he does a lot of studying outside school. He is a very big tech guy. I got my inspiration from my brother. He doesn't play a lot of sports but tries to attend in it. Although he fights with me on silly things, he cares for me a lot. My brother often shares his computer and chocolates with me and we have fun playing together. My brother is kind of fat. But he wants to start working out.  </p>

            <h2>Tasfin Zaraf(My Cousin)</h2>   
            <p class="paragraph">Tasfin is probably my favorite cousin. He is just about 2 years old. He is now learning to speak. Me and my brother named him Tasfin. His eyes are bright, his smile shining, and his personality exuding confidence like no other; freckles don't pale his skin, and his proud yet humble stance gives him a look of kindness. He is, to put it simply outgoing. Anyone who has come across my cousin Tasfin could easily tell you that.</p>
